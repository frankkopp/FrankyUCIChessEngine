{In 1930 Mikenas, born in Tallin, capital of Estonia, was just 20 years old,

strongest and most known grandmasters around in that period} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6
3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 dxc4 5. a4 {Bogoljubov was considered a very good expert of
the Slave Defense. He had proved that the year before (1929) during his match
against Alekhine. But Mikenas did not care about that. He had studied openings
very carefully, and the strategic ideas and right in the Slave he had a
novelty. Was not this a good opportunity to test it?} 5... Bf5 {In the first

battle in the opening has been clearly won by Mikenas, so that Bogoljubov is
induced to offer a draw. Mikenas: "I declined the offer. I saw surprise on my
opponent's face. Was I wrong? In my opinion, my will to continue the fight has
solid basis."} 19. Rd1 Bb4 {Played with a little bit of presumption  Right was

a6 f5 {This move seriously weakens the e6 Pawn, and this will strenghten the
pressure of White.} 21. exf5 Bxf5 22. Kf2 Nb6 23. Na2 {Now the attack against
the c6 Pawn begins. Mikenas: "I remember that I felt amazed by the fact that
right me, a chessplayer with tactical style and sometimes a bit messy,
succeeded to play such a convincing game against such an expert grandmaster.
After the game Bogoljubov congratulated with me for this move."} 23... Be7 24.

ntraddicts the strategical principles indicated by the theory. Since Turn knew
that Mikenas had a deep theoretical preparation, he decided this line of play
in order to surprise the opponent.} 5... Nc6 6. Bd3 {A bit inaccurate. The

8.Ne2 with initiative on the kingside after 9.e4.} 8. f4 {In fact, the capture
8. Qxg7 after 8... Rg8 9. Qh6 Rxg2 would have given a very promising position

When problems are complex the right reply is not always found. Perhaps better
was 12. Qxd4 although even in this case Black can keep some more possibilites
in view of the endgame. For example: 12... Bc5 13. Qe5 Rxg2 14. Ne4 Bxe4 15.
Bxe4 Ng4 16. Qh8+ Ke7 17. Qxd8+ Rxd8 18. Ne5 Bb4+ 19. Kf1 Rf2+ 20. Kg1 Re2 and

for 14. Be4 Qh4+ 15.Kd1 Nf2+ 16. Kc2 and the attack vanishes.} 14. Nf3 {

"Sometimes may happen that a chess game is repeated from the first move to the
last one. It is possible when an unexperienced player in the opening play some
natural- and good-looking move. Indeed such moves drive him to a defeat. One
of such games will be now shown to you. The following opening is very common
in amateur practice, and my opponent, an enthusiastic amateur has played it
four times against me." Chigorin does not tell us if there was a fifth time
where his opponent, convinced by the previous four kicks, found the right
continuation. I think this player should be remembered as "Knorr the
tenacious".} 1... e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Bc5 4. d3 Nf6 5. O-O d6 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4

should scratch his head and think about it one, two, ten times before doing it.

{This game was preceeded by a funny story. Mikenas says: "The evening before I
was having dinner in a restaurant was, unexpectedly, Alekhine approached my
table and sat down. Although he looked in good shape, some nervousness was
apparent, probably due to his defeat in a match against Euwe in 1935 and his
loss of the title of world champion. I invited him for a drink. He refused,
kindly but firmly: - Milk only, please! - he answered. I have to win the world
champion title back, and I will not allow myself any lack of control. - Then
he confessed - If I have lost the title it is because of such damned drinks!.
I congratulated with him for his firm self discipline. For few minutes we
talked about anything, then he greeted me like a good friend with his best
wishes for my next game and went away. After few minutes he came back in hurry:
- Who is your opponent for tomorrow's game? - he asked me, visibly shaken.
"You, dr. Alekhine" I answered with a smile. The day after, just before the
game, Alekhine did not look very well. It is known that many GMs are
superstitious, and Alekhine was in this category. He certainly believed that
his best wishes for my game were a bad omen for him, and when a man believes
in such things sometimes gets confused.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 Bg7 4. Bg2 d5

piece of sugar in the coffee cup. Only at the last moment he realized that it
was not a piece of sugar but ... a white pawn. While he realized his mistake,
he got upset, said something, pushed the cup away and .... coffee spilled out
of the cup. Mikenas too noticed his opponent apparent nervousness, and perhaps
distracted by this fact he immediately took the Knight.} 23... Bxe4 {After this
move Mikenas realized that strangely his opponent was smiling. With a

{I think it is interesting to know the opinion of Emanuel Lasker on Schlechter
as a chessplayer: "Honestly, I cannot find any waek point in Schlechter... He
seems to understand anytime his position on the chessboard in perfect and
objective way. If it is good, he attacks firmly and energetically. If his
position is draw he plays prudently and carefully. Finally, if his position is
leading him towards the defeat, then he becomes audacious, prepares for his
opponent intelligent and unthinkable traps, he attacks passionately or builds
extraordinary defense.... a true fighter."} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. Bg5

{Frank Marshall, the famous American player, was a fearless chess cowboy who
at the first chance would rush into unpredictable complications. His
aggressive style multiplied by youthful energy and natural optimism rewarded
him with convincing victories in three big international tournaments. In 1904
at Cambridge Springs Marshall was first with the phenomenal result of +11, -0,
=4, two points ahead of Lasker! Enthusastic American sponsors soon raised the
money for Marshall to challenge Lasker for the World Championship title. But
the crushing final score of this match, +8, -0, =7 in favour of Lasker, showed
that both players belonged in different leagues. Frank Marshall, der beruehmte
amerikanische Spieler, war ein furchtloser Schach-Cowboy, der sich gern bei
jeder Gelegenheit in unuebersehbare Komplikationen stuerzte. Sein aggressiver
Stil, potenziert durch jugendliche Energie und natuerlichen Optimismus, wurde
in drei grossen internationalen Turnieren mit ueberzeugenden Siegen belohnt.

that long-term factors could override temporary inconvenience. The white minor
pieces will gain extra tempi attacking Black's queen. White's better control
of the centre will help him to organize future attacks and also to prevent
Black's pieces from harmonious development. As it later turned out Steinitz'
Gambit was proven to be not very dangerous for Black, but only as a result of
precise and very dynamic play. Not surprisingly Steinitz' opponents, who
weren't ready to take this ugly opening seriously, couldn't resist testing his
revolutionary strategy.} 5... d6 {Some players tried the sharper 5...d5

{Many strong chess players and, of course, World Champions have found new
moves and ideas that changed the evaluation of different opening systems. But
just a few of us were lucky enough to introduce new plans that transformed the
core of opening and middlegame strategy. The impression and clarity of the
plan put forward by Steinitz in this game was so strong that the whole line
starting with 4.e5 was later called the "Steinitz Variation" in the French
Defence. Please do not be disappointed by the relative weakness of Black's
play - to some extent it helped Steinitz to demonstrate the essence of his
plan in the purest form. The average international player simply couldn't
think in long-term categories that marked Steinitz well-thought strategy.} 1.

{The match with Siegbert Tarrasch in 1908 was one of the crucial tests of
Lasker's chess philosophy. Dr Tarrasch, an adamant supporter of the Steinitz
theories, was unjustly called a "heartless dogmatic" by the following
generations. In fact his tireless propagation of Steinitz's positional ideas
made a great contribution to the development of chess and enormously improved
the quality of average players. As for his chess practice, Dr Tarrasch did not
spoil it by strictly adhering to the simplified views and rules he advocated
in his books. Many brilliant victories and very stable performances in
international tournaments for almost two decades made him a real contender for
the world championship title. But his deep belief in the absolute power of the
"best moves" made him oblivious to the "nonsense" about the importance of
irrational psychological factors that were said to influence the course of the
game. Against Lasker this stubbornness was suicidal. Their match, which was
played until eight wins, ended clearly in Lasker's favour: +8, -3, =5.
Undoubtedly game four was a decisive one! Das Match mit Siegbert Tarrasch 1908
war eine kritische Pruefung fuer die Philosophie Laskers. Dr. Tarrasch, ein
eiserner Verfechter von Steinitz' Theorien, wurde von nachfolgenden
Generationen zu Unrecht als "herzloser Dogmatiker" apostrophiert. Tatsaechlich
hat sein unermuedliches Eintreten fuer die positionellen Ideen von Steinitz
einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Fortentwicklung des Schachspiels geleistet und das
Niveau von durchschnittlichen Schachspielern gesteigert. Und was sein Spiel
anbelangt, pflegte Dr. Tarrasch selbst sich nicht allzu streng an die Lehren
zu halten, die er in seinen Buechern darlegte. Viele brillante Siege und eine
insgesamt sehr stabile Leistung bei internationalen Turnieren liessen ihn zu
einem echten Anwaerter fuer den Titel des Weltmeisters werden. Allerdings
machte sein tiefer Glaube an die absolute Macht von "besten Zuegen" ihn wenig
empfaenglich fuer den "Unsinn" ueber psychologische Einfluesse, die den
Ausgang der Partien beeinflussen sollten. Gegen Lasker hatte diese
Dickkoepfigkeit fatale Folgen. Ihr Match, das um acht Gewinnpartien gespielt
wurde, endete klar zugunsten von Lasker. Zweifelsohne war die vierte Partie
eine entscheidende!  } 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 Nf6 4. O-O d6 5. d4 Bd7 6.

with the opening results: White has a small but constant advantage, and there
are chances to increase it without any risk. One would guess that Tarrasch
expected something like 15...Nf8 and planned 16.Nd4 with growing pressure.
Lasker knew that his best chance to avoid a long, maybe painful defence was to
take Tarrasch out of his confident mood by doing something very provocative
(on the chess board, of course!). And so he moves his rook contrary to all
rules of conventional wisdom:  Ich glaube, dass Tarrasch mit dem Ergebnis aus
der Eroeffnung recht zufrieden gewesen ist: Weiss hat einen kleinen, aber
anhaltenden Vorteil, und es gibt Moeglichkeiten, diesen Vorteil ohne Risiko zu
vergroessern. Man kann vermuten, dass Tarrasch vielleicht einen Zug wie 15...
Sf8 erwartete, wonach er 16.Sd4 mit wachsendem Druck geplant haben duerfte.
Lasker wusste indes, dass der beste Weg, eine lange, qualvolle Verteidigung zu
vermeiden, darin bestand, den Gegner aus seiner zufriedenen Stimmung
herauszureissen. Das tat er mit einem provokativen Zug (auf dem Brett
natuerlich!), der wider jede schachliche Vernunft zu gehen schien:  } 15... Re5

schachlichen Gesichtspunkten ist diese Idee sehr verdaechtig: der schlecht
postierte Turm kann Schwarz etliche Probleme bereiten. Aber das Ziel war, dass
Tarrasch angesichts dieses frechen Turmes aus der Fassung kommen sollte.  } 17.

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. d3 {Anderssen first adopted this
move in his match against Morphy, which at the time caused a great deal of
animadversion amongst theorists, who were inclined towards advocating a more
energetic attack than the nature of the opening apparently can bear. But we
believe that the great German master showed a true appreciation of the spirit
of this opening, which requires a treatment similar to that of the close game,
namely, a steadfast gradual development, content with the small advantage of
the first move.} 5... d6 {Morphy played here invariably 5...b5, followed by 6..
.Bc5; the move in the text was first brought into practice by Paulsen, and was
afterwards accepted as the standard defense, which in the majority of games
hitherto played has proven successful.} 6. c3 {Anderssen prefers here 6.Bxc6+,
and then directs his attention to retaining both his knights, and preventing
the adversary from dissolving his doubled pawn. White persues here a different,
and in the present position novel, policy, and makes preparation for retaining
his light-square bishop, and resting his game upon confining the opponent's
dark-square bishop. Whether this plan is an amelioration of Anderssen's line
of attack can only be proved by repeated practical trials.} 6... Be7 {
Against Anderssen's form of attack in this debut it is more usual to open an
outlet for the bishop by 6...g6. Black prefers to get his king into safety as
soon as possible, and therefore at once makes room to enable him to castle.} 7.
h3 {Not so much for defensive purposes as with the view of subsequently
fortifying an attack by pawn to g4 against the opponent's kingside, after the
latter has castled.} 7... O-O 8. Qe2 Ne8 9. g4 b5 10. Bc2 Bb7 11. Nbd2 Qd7 12.
Nf1 {This peculiar way of bringing the knight over to the kingside was much
favored by Morphy in similar situations, and was also adopted by Blackburne in
the tie match against Steintiz in the Vienna tournament. But both those
players had elected that course after having previously brought out thier
c1-bishop, while here White seemed to have time for this maneuver, even at the
cost of remporarily blocking out his dark-square bishop.} 12... Nd8 13. Ne3 Ne6
14. Nf5 g6 {For pure defensive purposes it would have been feasible to retreat
the bishop to d8; but Blackburne thinks that after the exchange, and since his
adversary was compelled to castle on the queenside, the chances of an attack
were at least equally balanced for both sides.} 15. Nxe7+ Qxe7 16. Be3 N8g7 17.
O-O-O c5 18. d4 exd4 19. cxd4 c4 {Blackburne poined out that 19...d5 would
have been much stronger at this juncture, and there can be no doubt that this
move would have much improved his game. White's best answer then would have
been 20.e5 (for if 20.exd5 instead, Black would rejoin 20...Nf4, with an
excellent game). Most likely the game would have proceeded thus: 19...d5 20.e5
c4 21.h4 and now, whether Black advanced 21...f5 or 21...h5, White retained
still some considerable attack; in the former by 22.exf5, followed by 23.Ne5,
and in the latter case by the answer of 23.Ng5, followed soon by pawn to f4.
But, nevertheless, Black had a better chance then of repelling the onslaught,
and certainly if he once got out of the attack, even at the expense of
sacrificing a piece eventually, his fine array of well-supported pawns on the
queen's wing would have been most formidable.} 20. d5 Nc7 21. Qd2 {A move neces
sary for defensive purposes, but also threatening. Before moving the queen,
White could not utilize his dark-square bishop without subjecting his d-pawn
to capture. Now White menaces a break in with the queen, either at a5 or h6,
after removing the bishop, as actually occurred.} 21... a5 22. Bd4 f6 23. Qh6
b4 24. g5 f5 {Perhaps 24...Nge8, with the intention of offering the exchange
of queens at g7, would have augmented Black's prospects of prolonging the
fight; but, even if he succeeded in effecting the exchange, White's pawns and
pieces were better situated for the endgame.} 25. Bf6 Qf7 {The sacrifice of
the rook for the bishop would not have mended matters, on account of the
impending 27.Ng5, after capturing the rook. Nor would 25...Qd7 have been any
better, e.g.: 25...Qd7 26.exf5 Nxf5 (if 26...gxf5 instead, White would proceed
with 27.g6 at once) 27.Bxf5 gxf5 28.g6 Rxf6 29.gxh7+, and wins; for if 29...
Kf7 30.Ng5+ would be a destructive rejoinder.} 26. exf5 gxf5 27. g6 {Decisive (
for, if 27...hxg6, White replies 28.Ng5), though rather plain in comparision
with the fine variation which might have arisen in answer to 27.Nh4, which
would probably have led to a still more elegant conclusion, e.g.: 27.Nh4 Nxd5
28.Rxd5 Bxd5 29.Nxf5 Nxf5 (best) 30.Bxf5, threatening pawn to g6, and must win,
for Black dare not take the rook on account of the answer 31.Be6.} 27... Qxg6
28. Bxg7 Qxh6+ 29. Bxh6 Rf6 {There was little to be done; but certainly, if
Black wished to proceed further, 29...Rf7 presented greater chances of
prolonging resistance; but, as our readers may observe, both players were just
at this stage on the point of completing the fixed time limit, and their
movements bear the appearance of being hurried.} 30. Rhg1+ Rg6 31. Bxf5 Kf7 32.
Bxg6+ hxg6 33. Ng5+ Kg8 34. Rge1 {White threatens, accordingly to

greater facilities for the defense, and has, perhaps, the advantage for match
play that it has not received such an exhaustive analysis as the line of play
pursued in the above mentioned game. 9...} 9... Nf6 {In the altered position
this appears better than the mode of development for this knight advocated by
Messrs Potter and Steinitz in their analysis of the above quoted game, namely
9...Nh6 (see The Field, April 18, 1874). The chief reason given by those two
examiners was the weakness of Black's f-pawn, which might more specially
compromise the defense, since the first player had, in a great many variations,
fine opportunities of attacking that weak point with one of his knights; but
in the present position, after the queen in place of the knight has retaken
the bishop, such a contingency was too remote to be taken into serious
consideration, and it was probably the best course to defend at once the point
at d5 against any future occupation from either of the adversary's knights.}

dangerous pawn. 18...} 18... Nc6 {Black's last two moves were made under the
pressure of time limit, and under the impression that he could advance the
pawn to b5 if the opponent retreated the queen to b3; but it appears that
after White's next answer this expedient could not be adopted, e.g., 19.Qb3 b5
20.Bf3 Bb7 21.Qxf7 Ne5 22.Rxe5 Qxe5 23.Bxb7 Rb8 24.Bc6, etc.} 19. Qb3 Rf8 20.

displaying his power of brilliant resource. 20...Qc5 was the correct play.} 21.
Bf3 Bb7 {Had Black captured the knight, the adversary would have recovered the
piece at once by 22.Qa3, attacking the rook, followed by 23.Bxc6.} 22. Nd5 Rb8
{Probably 22...Kc8 would have been the much safer line of play. The move in
the text subjects Black to a most vehement attack, from which he ought hardly
to have escaped.} 23. Qa3 Rg8 24. Ne5 {At this extremely critical juncture,
Blackburne, who had conducted the attack in an excellent manner, was
unfortunately very hard pressed for time so much that he had ultimately, on
the 29th move, to take advantage of the five minutes' grace accorded by the
conditions, and he was unable to work out in all its details the very fine
combination he afterwards pointed out, and which, though apparently hazardous,
was, so far as our examination goes, quite sound in all variations. He ought
to have played here 24.Re5, and the game might have gone on thus: 24.Re5 Nxe5
(or 24...Qh4 25.Nxf6 Qxf6 [or 25...gxf6 26.Re4 Qh3 (best) 27.Bg4, and wins] 26.

than 30.Qxc8+, which would only draw the game), and wins. 24...} 24... Nxe5 25.
Qe7+ Kc8 26. Rxe5 Nxd5 27. Qxf7 Qd8 28. Bxd5 Bxd5 29. Rexd5 {[2:00-?:??]; No
doubt is would have much improved White's position if he had here retaken with
the other rook, and reserved the e-rook to occupy e7. 29...} 29... d6 30. R5d3
Qe8 {
At this stage the game was adjourned, and was resumed after an hour's interval.
} 31. Qd5 Rf8 {[?:??-2:00]} 32. Qd4 Rf6 {Here Steinitz proposed a draw, and
Blackburne admits that the offer was a fair one, as the position and forces
were quite even; but Blackburne in refusing the offer, relied chiefly upon the
circumstances that his opponent had exhausted about seventeen minutes of his
third hour over the last two moves, and he trusted the chance of inveigling
Black into such complications as would necessitate his consuming more time
than the limit would allow, or cause him to make some ill-considered move of
which advantage could be taken.} 33. Re3 Qc6 34. Rde1 {34.Qa7 would have been
of no use, for Black would have replied 34...Qb6, and, if White checked with
the rook, the Black king would move to d7, and White could not then take the
rook with the queen, on account of the impending mate, commencing with 36...
Qxf2+, followed by the sacrifice of the queen at f1. 34...} 34... Kb7 35. Rc3

the text gave him more aggressive chances.} 36. Rce3 Rbf8 37. f3 R8f7 38. Re8
Qc6 39. c3 Rf5 40. R8e7 Rd5 41. Qh4 {[3:00-?:??]; White could not well
sacrifice the queen for two rooks by playing 41.Rxf7 for Black would win at
least two pawns on the queenside by 42...Qd5, after capturing the queen and
the opponent's retaking the rook with the pawn. Nevertheless 41.Qf2 was better
than the move in the text. 41...} 41... Qc5+ 42. Kf1 g5 43. Qe4 {Again 43.Qf2
was preferable, but Blackburne had here to fight against the difficulty of
making all his moves up to the 45th within the five minutes grace allowed to
him, he having already exhausted his limit on the 41st move. 43...} 43... Rxe7

58...Qf1+, followed accordingly either by the exchange of queens, or the
immediate advance of the a-pawn. 58...} 58... Qb3+ {Now White's king and queen

it has not received any analytical attention, and we believe that this is the
first occasion of it having been introduced into practice in an important
match game. White must recover the pawn he now offers, and the position
afterwards is about even; but Blackburne and Zukertort are of the opinion that
the retention of the two bishops gives the second player the superior game,

frustrated this neat design. As it stands, if White take the bishop with the
rook, Black would answer 26...Rxe1+, etc.} 26. Rxe6 Bxd1 27. Rd6 Ke7 {
Fortunately for Steinitz, his opponent was at this point short of time, or
else the latter could not have failed to see that he could win the exchange by
27...Be5, threatening 28...g3. White had then no better reply than 28.Rxd4,

found time to strengthen his position by pawn to g3.} 28. Ra6 Rc7 29. Kf1 Rd7 {

only have had the effect of drawing the king up to the support of his passed
d-pawn; for Black could have safely answered 32...Kd5, followed by 33...Ke4 if
the knight checked at f4, and White would then have found it of no avail to
protect the knight by 34.Bg3, threatening mate with the rook, since Black
could provide an escape by 34...d3, which also cleared the road to his own
victory.} 32... Bc2 33. Ke2 Kf6 {Black played this with the anticipation that
White would answer 34.Kd2, whereupon he would capture the knight, followed by
35...Kg6, which would have given him a good game.} 34. Ra6+ {White failed here
to take the promptest advantage of the opponent's error. He might have taken
the a-pawn with the rook at once, but still the move adopted, drove the king
back, forced the gain of a pawn, and secured at least a draw.} 34... Kg7 {
A grave error, for it loses two pawns at once. He ought to have 34...Ke7; but
even in that case his game was not comfortable, and he must have lost the
a-pawn by the answer of 35.Nc5, without being able to make any impression with
his passed d-pawn, which could easily be stopped.} 35. Rxa7 Rxa7 36. Bxd4+ Kf7

paralysing the action of one of the knights.} 12. Bf3 Nge7 13. Rad1 Qf5 {

the opponent when he is short of time, by raising complications even at great
hazard. The present incorrect, strictly speaking, sacrifice belongs to that
category. The defense was extremely ticklish, and, as Steinitz had nearly
exhausted his second hour, the chances were in favor of his not hitting always

gave the most chances of continuing the pressure of a violent onslaught. Had
he played the 21.Qf4, Black might have replied 21...Ne5; for if 22.Rxe5, the
pawn would retake, attacking the queen. Blackburne informs us that at the time
he sacrificed the knight he contemplated at this point to move 21.Qc5, and,
upon the opponent answering 21...Qg5, to leave the queen en prise, and take
the e-knight with the rook, e.g: 21.Qc5 Qg5 22.Rxe7 Qxc5 23.Rexd7+ Kb6 24.

1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. f4 d5 4. d3 Bb4 {This rarely adopted variation
transfers to the second player the attack, which is, however, a short-lived
one if properly defended.} 5. fxe5 Nxe4 {This sacrifice of the knight is a
novel introduction. 5...d4 is generally preferred at this point, and is
usually continued thus: 5...d4 6.exf6 dxc3 7.b3 Qxf6 8.Nf3 Bg4 9.Be2 Nc6 etc.,

has got in play besides his queen.} 10... Bh5 {Black would have lost a piece
if he had taken the knight with the pawn checking, for White would have simply
retaken with the pawn, and Black would have been compelled to sacrifice the
pinned bishop for the adverse f-pawn, and then White's king would have easily
reached a safe goal after a few checks from the opponent.} 11. Ke3 {A number of
ingenious traps were laid for White by Black's last move. Had he now moved 11.
Kd2, the reply would have been 11...Qg4; and if White attacked the queen by 12.
h3, Black would have checked with the queen at f4, followed by 13...Qg3+, if
13.Ke1 or, in the other alternative, if 13.Kd1, he would have won, by 13...
exf3, followed by 14...fxg2+, in answer to 14.Bxf4 etc. Again, if White now
moved 11.Kd1 at once, Black might have sacrificed the queen by 11...exf3; for,
if 12.Qxh4 in reply, he could also proceed to leave the bishop en prise by 12..
.fxg2+, winning the rook and making a new queen.} 11... Bxf3 12. Bb5+ {
The only move to prevent an immediate draw, which Black would have obtained by
checking backwards and forwards with the queen at e1 and h4, if White had
captured the bishop at once with the pawn. White wished to avoid thatcontingenc
y, relying upon his king getting into the middle of the board, ready to
support the pawns of both wings, if he succeeded in exchanging queens, which
would be more favorable to him in the endgame.} 12... c6 13. gxf3 cxb5 14. Qxe4
Qh6+ {Much superior to exchanging queens at once, whereupon White would have
retaken with the king. White's king is now driven more to the rear and the
exchange can be afforded more conveniently on the next move. If White in reply
move 15.f4, Black would obtain a good game by 15...Nc6.} 15. Kf2 {[1:00-?:??]}
15... Qc6 16. Qd4 Na6 {Black chose this mode of development for the knight
with the object of getting rid of the hostile bishop as early as possible. 16..
.Nd7 would have led to various complications of a character which must have
made Black's game exceedingly difficult, for White would have replied 17.Rg1
attacking the g-pawn, which could not be defended by 17...g6 or 17...0-0, on
account of the rejoinder 18.e6.} 17. Ba3 b4 {[?:??-1:00]  Black could not
afford to allow the bishop to be planted at d6, and the sacrifice of the pawn
was quite judicious under the circumstances that White's material advantage
consisted afterwards in a doubled pawn.} 18. Bxb4 Nxb4 19. Qxb4 Rc8 20. Rab1 b6
{Taking the c-pawn would have led to an exchange disadvantageous to Black, e.g.
: 20...Qxc3 21.Qxc3 Rxc3 22.Rxb7 Rxc2+ 23.Ke3, and wins the a-pawn.} 21. Rb3
Rd8 22. Re1 Rd5 23. Re4 Qh6 {The counter attack looked promising at first
sight; but 23...Rc5, with the object of castling, was in reality safer play.
White's best reply was then to challenge the exchange of queens by 24.Qa4, and
he would have still retained the best of the game, but his chances of winning
must have been considerably diminished in that case.} 24. h4 g5 {"A desperate
sortie, which involves the exposure of the K to a strong attack by White's
forcible reply. Q to B 8 offered better chances of recovering ground, though
White would even then have kept the attack in hand by Q to R 4, ch. followed
either by Q takes R P, or by R to Kt 4, according to Black's reply."} 25. e6

check at a4.} 26. Qa4+ Ke7 {Again the only move. Had he interposed the rook,
White would have won as follows, supposing-26...Rd7 27.Rd4 Qg7 28.Rxb6 axb6 29.
Qa8+ Ke7 30.Rxd7+ Kf6 (best; for if 30...Kxd7, White wins the queen by 31.Qa7+)

33. Rf4+ {[2:00-?:??]; The following note leads me to suspect that Black's
32nd move is actually 32...Rd1 (R-Q8 vs R-Q3 in descriptive). If this is the
case then the note dealing with the exchange of two rooks for queen begins to
make sense (R to B 4, ch. being Rf5+ so the pawn can capture on f5!-[Pope];
"Here White missed the shortest way of winning the game right off. He ought to
have doubled the rooks by moving the same rook to K Kt 4, threatening Q to B 4,
ch. followed by R to Kt 7, ch. He might have also won here two rooks for the Q
by R to B 4, ch. Black had then nothing better than to capture the R with the
P, for if he attempted to support the Q by K to Kt 3, R to B 6, ch. followed.
But the latter mode of play left, however, the chances of long protracted and
perhaps complicated fight open, and the line of play in the text had therefore
the preference of greater simplicity, though it was not as prompt and decisive
as our first suggestion."} 33... Ke7 34. Qe5 {

give us a certain malicious pleasure, compensating for our own blunders; and
(what is more important) these imperfect games generally take an attractively

{<<...I could not have lived without chess; on walks and even in my sleep I
was pursued by the pieces, and in my head a genuine battle took place...The
game of chess is the ideal aim of my life!>> wrote Pillsbury in his
autobiography. The great American player Harry Nelson Pillsbury is an unusual
exception among the majority of his famous colleagues. Not only was he no
child prodigy, but until the age of 16 he altogheter knew nothing of chess.
But within just five years, in the mid 1890s, Pillsbury was already one of the
top masters, and was successfully competing even with World Champions.
Pillsbury also became renowned for his phenomenal ability at blindfold chess -
he could simultaneously battle against more then twenty opponents. Pillsbury
also introduced much into chess theory. It is sufficient to recall his famous
counter-attack in the Queen's Gambit (usually known as the Cambridge-Springs
Defence - n.T.) and his very powerful attacking set-up in another variation of
the same opening. Even today his ideas are used at the very highest level (for
example, in the 1983 Candidates 1/4 Final match Kasparov-Belyavsky). For this
reason the opinion of the chess historian Ludwig Bachmann constitutes a
misconception:<< ...Pillsbury did not open any new paths in chess, did not
become a teacher and was not a creator.>>  On the contrary, many prominent
players of an active positional style, born in 20th century, are to a greater
or lesser extent his pupils.  In the present game there was not a tense
struggle. The position of White, who was the first chess king, collapsed of
its own accord...} 1. e4 e5 2. f4 Bc5 3. Nf3 d6 4. Bc4 Nc6 5. c3 {The opening
is an unusual hybrid of the King's Gambit and Italian Game. This experiment

the young Pillsbury was required. An amusing fact is that White's last move in
this given position has not found its way into modern opening guides...  5...}

{The first part of the following game (up to 17th move) consists mainly in
consolidating monoeuvres on either side. We then see how a localised
contest-conducted on what appears to be a sector of secondary
importance-unexpectedly becomes the principal theme of the game, thanks in the
main to Black's beautiful pawn sacrifice (19...c3) an the coordination of his

Black's normal strategy would be to storm forwards on the King side with his
mobile pawns, but the fact that White's KP is on e2 rather then e4 makes it
more difficult for Black to fix on a target. White's normal plan would be to
launch a Queen side advance with b2-b4, c4-c5 etc. breaking into Black's camp
at the sensitive point c7. However, the absence of White's KP from e4 also
exerts an influence over White's plan of campaign in that (after c4-c5) is QP
will be deprived of much of his support. In such strategically complex
position Numzowitsch excelled. Now many of his original ideas have been
absorbed into master tecnique or incorporated into "openings theory".} 13. Qd2

Black's KP and KBP. 14...} 14... a5 15. Rab1 Nc5 {Provocation. Also possible
was the more solipstic procedure Rf7,Qf8 followed by h7-h6 and g6-g5. But
Nimzowitsch prefers to encourage activity from his opponent since he correctly
perceives that this very activity will ultimately be White's undoing.} 16. b3
Rf7 $1 {And prophylaxis! Observe the way in which Nimzowitsch guards the c7
point before it is attacked.} 17. a3 Qf8 18. Rfc1 h5 {A device for gaining
space on the King side which is now regulation in the King's Indian Defence.
Given time Black will also play g6-g5 with an awesome array of pawns.} 19. b4
axb4 20. axb4 Nd7 21. c5 {This temporary sacrifice of a pawn looks most
promising since it exposes a number of weaknesses in the Black position.
However, with this move White is walking straight into a combinative ambush;
it could be said that he started out on the ambush trail when he was lured
into a Queen side advance (with gain of tempo) by 15...Nc5, but what other
choice did White have? Black holds the initiative on the King wing so the only
alternative to Queen side activity would be passive defence. Attractive though
its execution might appear Nimzowitsch had prepared so efficiently for the
possibility of a White Queen side advance that the whole plan of carrying it
through could be classed as a collective error.} ({If} 21. Ra1 {

time. In fact he has been engaged in the accumulation of attacking energy (QR
file, h6-d2 diagonal, mobile pawn mass, etc.) and now emerges with a series of
noxious blows which had completely escaped White's attention. We might add, by
the way, that without Black's cooperation (the partly superfluous and partly
provocatory Nc5) White would scarcely ever have been able to arrange his
break-through with pawn-c5. (Nimzowitsch)} 24... Bh6 25. f4 exf4 26. gxf4 $2 (
